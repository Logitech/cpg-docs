Logitech Documentation
======================

This repository holds public documentation for the protocols used to
interact with some Logitech devices.

Protocol index:
  - `HID++ 2.0 <hidpp20>`_

The final goal of this repository is to expose the documentation in a
uniform format. While we achieve this, some documentation is
available albeit in various shapes. Hoping that they will be
useful 'as is' they can be obtained from this `Google Drive
folder`_.
